# Passenger Re-accommodation for a planned Schedule Change
## Overview
Airlines often adjust their flight schedules for various reasons, such as seasonal demands, route optimization, and operational changes. These modifications can disrupt passengers' travel plans, necessitating re-accommodation onto alternative flights. This project addresses the challenge of efficiently managing passenger re-accommodation in response to planned schedule changes.

## Problem Statement
This problem was presented by Mphasis Organization during INTER IIT Techmeet 12.0. The objective is to develop a solution that automatically analyzes the impact of schedule changes on passengers and identifies suitable alternate flights for affected individuals.

## Solutions
We have devised four comprehensive solutions to tackle this challenge. Detailed descriptions of each solution are provided in the report.pdf. Please refer to the document for in-depth insights into our proposed approaches.
